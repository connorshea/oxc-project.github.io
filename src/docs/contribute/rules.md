# Introduction

## PR Rules

- We [prefer smaller PRs](https://graphite.dev/blog/how-large-prs-slow-down-development).
- Try stacked PRs with [graphite](https://graphite.dev) if you have write access, which will be given to you when you contribute a lot.
- Please create an issue or discussion if the PR contains architectural changes.

## Development Policy

- Embrace data-oriented design.
- Keep APIs simple and well-documented.
- Always provide a reference to the source if the implementation is from another project.

### Performance

- All performance issues are considered as bugs in this project, this includes all runtime and compilation performance issues.
  - Follow guidance from the [Rust performance book](https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/introduction.html).
  - Minimize the use of the `regex` crate. Use Rust iterators and string methods for better performance.
- Compile time must be minimized to reduce impact on development workflow and downstream tools.
  - Minimize third-party dependencies to reduce compilation speed and project complexity.
  - Avoid heavy macros, generics, or any Rust techniques that slow down compilation.
  - Our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain) complete in 3 minutes, any regressions need to be fixed.

## Maintenance Policy

- Monitor code coverage for unused code. Aim for 99% code coverage.
- Actively monitor and work on reducing the CI time to speed up merging of PRs. The current CI time on GitHub actions is around 3 minutes.
- Documentation first - documentation should serve as the source of truth. Keep the documentation updated and share the link instead of repeatedly answering the same questions. See GitLab's [handbook-first](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first) approach.
- Consistent import orders: "furthest away" to "closest".
  - `std`
  - External crates
  - Oxc crates
  - Local crate (`crate`)
  - `super`
  - `mod`

## Conventional Commits

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers:

- `fix`: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase.
- `feat`: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase.
- BREAKING CHANGE: a appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change, e.g. `feat(parser)!: new feature`.
- the scopes are crate names.
- the types are `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:` and `test:`.

## Action Policy

Taken from [Astral's values](https://astral-sh.notion.site/Astral-s-Values-0ed6a642bcc84e91af6836b2373572f5):

> We bias towards action, even in the face of uncertainty. We favor _pragmatic doing_ over **prolonged debating**; we favor asking for _forgiveness_ over _permission_. We value **decisiveness — especially** when a decision isn’t clear cut, and **especially** when a decision is reversible.
>
> A bias towards action is _not_ the same as recklessness. Rather, it’s a bias towards making _responsible_ decisions and acting on them with _urgency_, even if we’re left with lingering ambiguity or known unknowns.
